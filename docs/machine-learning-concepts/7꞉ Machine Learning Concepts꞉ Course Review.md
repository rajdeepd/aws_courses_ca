# 7: Machine Learning Concepts: Course Review

Welcome back. Before we finish, let's do a quick review of what we have learned. We gained an understanding of what Machine Learning is and what it offers. We gained an understanding of the benefits of using Machine Learning. We learned about the different business use cases and scenarios that have benefited from using Machine Learning. We learned about the difference between Supervised and Unsupervised training. We learned about the difference between Classification and Regression. We reviewed several of the commonly used and popular Machine Learning algorithms, and finally, we reviewed the basic principles behind Deep Learning and Deep Neural Networks as a specialized form of Machine Learning.
