# Decision Trees

## Introduction

Welcome back. In this lecture we'll introduce you to Decision Trees. In Machine Learning, a decision tree is a type of predictive modeling approach.

In the demonstration we give later on, we'll implement a Decision Tree to provide us with an ability to make predictions. Let's continue on and dive a bit deeper into the details of what a Decision Tree is and how they are created.

## What are Decision Trees?

To start with, Decision Trees are Machine Learning models that are in the form of tree structures. Decision trees are one of the most popular and widely used Machine Learning algorithms. 



A Decision Tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm and is nothing more than a tree in which each non-leaf node represents a decision between a set of choices in where the leaf nodes are the final decision or classification.

## Types of Decision trees

There are two types of Decision Trees used in Machine Learning. The Classification Tree. An analysis where the predicted outcome is the class to which the data belongs. For example, the color is red or the person is male.

Regression Tree. An analysis where the predicted outcome can be considered a real number. For example, someone's income or the time it will take to solve a customer inquiry. Let's provide a quick example of how a Decision Tree works.

## Examples

A typical example involves trying to predict tomorrow's weather based on several features we know about today's weather. Let's assume we have been collecting the temperature, wind, and pressure attributes for each day of the past year, and whether or not it rained the following day. Using this type of data set together with a Decision Tree algorithm we can train our Machine Learning model to help us forecast for possibility of rain or not anytime in the future based on the weather attributes of the day before.

The decision tree presented on this slide is an example of what this model might end up looking like. Decision Tree's are a popular tool for Machine Learning practitioners for various reasons. 

## Advantages

Let's cover off some of the important advantages associated with Decision Trees. Decision Tree's are simple to understand and interpret. People are able to understand Decision Tree models after a brief explanation as they mirror human decision making.

Decision Trees are able to handle both numerical and categorical data. Decision Trees requite little or minimal data preparation. And finally, Decision Trees perform well with very large data sets.

## Summary

That concludes our lecture on Decision Trees. In the next lecture, we'll introduce you to Amazon Elastic MapReduce. Here, we'll learn about the EMR service and how it enables us to quickly spin up a cluster compute environment. Go ahead and close this lecture and we'll see you shortly in the next one.
