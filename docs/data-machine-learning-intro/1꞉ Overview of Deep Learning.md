# 1: Overview of Deep Learning

Hey, guys, welcome to this Zero to Deep Learning video course. My name is Francesco, and I will be your instructor for this course. The goal of this course is to provide you with a strong foundation in machine learning and deep learning. So whether you're just starting out with your practice of machine learning or you're a more experienced data scientist that is adding deep learning to the mix, I hope I'll provide you with enough information that serves as a solid base for you to continue learning after the course. We'll begin with simple data, structured data, and then we'll deal with images, with sound, with text, and more complex data that really is where deep learning shines. 

By the end of the course, you'll be able to recognize which problems can be solved with deep learning. You'll be able to organize your data in a way that can be used by a neural network. You'll be able to build a neural network model, including fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent neural network. And you'll be able to train a model using cloud computing, which is nowadays so accessible that I'll make sure that you're really able to use it. I'm really excited to bring to you this course. I hope you're excited to get started. So let's get started with section one, introduction.
