# 2: Introduction to Deep Learning

Maybe you like watching videos at high speed and a lot of them together. Or maybe you like pacing your study throughout the week, watching one video at a time. In either case, this course is designed to minimize your effort to follow it. The material is divided in sections, and each section is less than one hour long. Also, each section only deals with one topic, and it comes with an exercise at the end. So you can proceed in two ways. Either you can watch all the videos of that section and then do the exercise to check that you've really understood what I've explained in the videos, or you can do the reverse: start from the exercise and go back and check the videos whenever you feel you're not confident on how to solve a problem. 

Some videos will contain slides and a voiceover. Some will be screencasts where I show you how to do things. And some will be me talking and introducing new topics. The exercises come with a code that already works and some questions. The questions expand on the code that already works. But they're provided for you to really test your knowledge. We also provide you with the solution to the exercises. We encourage you not to check it before you've tried. In this section, we will talk about application of deep learning, and we'll make sure that your system is set up with all the necessary software to follow the course. So let's get started with section one, introduction.
